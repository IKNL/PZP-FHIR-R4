The Practitioner resource is referenced from the PractitionerRole instance. For this reason, sending systems should fill the reference to the PractitionerRole instance here, and not the Practitioner resource. Receiving systems can then retrieve the reference to the Practitioner resource from that PractitionerRole instance.\r\n\r\nIn rare circumstances, there is only a Practitioner instance, in which case it is that instance which can be referenced on the `Encounter.participant` element (due to open slicing). Since this should be the exception, the nl-core-HealthProfessional-Practitioner profile is not explicitly mentioned as a target profile."
